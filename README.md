# Azure onboarder
! All sensitive information has been removed from any scripts and documentation. !

This is a basic script that I used to set up automation in Azure to onboard new employees. 
The trigger is a Teams list that is updated

Script 1 created the new user in Azure and assigns them to a pre-group

Script 2 got more complex giving multiple options for groups as well as assigning licenses

Considering a Script 3 to make it so the email is first initial last name (jsmith@domain.com) and adding a loop to add extra letters to the email if the one created already exists.
